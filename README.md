# Transient Labs Dynamic Art Examples
## Purpose
This repository is meant to serve as a tool for creators looking to get into developing dynamic art themselves. It is not necessarily meant to teach you how to write code, however, we have included a list of resources for that below. 

You can take a look at some of the examples we have built and adjust them as you like, or you can get started with some blank templates. All the code is available in the public domain.

## Getting Started
You'll need to download a few things in order to get started building dynamic art. You can follow the next steps to create your first dynamic art piece!
1. Download a code editor. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), however, you can use any other code editor you like. The next steps assume you use VSCode.
2. Create a new folder on your computer and open it up in VSCode.
3. Create a new file: `File -> New File` and name it `hello-world.html`
4. Copy the content from `hello-world.html` file in this repository (`examples` folder) to the file you just created.
5. Next, you'll want to install the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) so that you can run your code locally without any issues.
    - Open the VS Code extension manager (`CTRL-SHIFT-X` / `CMD-SHIFT-X`)
    - Search for and install the Live Server extension
6. Right click on `hello-world.html` in VSCode and click on `Open with Live Server`.
7. If everything has been done successfully, you should see a meme pop up and a button to get a random programming meme!

## Educational Resources
You'll want to acquiant yourself with HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to build dynamic art yourself. These are the three building blocks of websites, which is essentially what dynamic art is. 

We've sectioned the resources into different types. If you are just getting started, we recommend the `General Overview Videos`. 

Once you've gone through those, you can either dive into the `Self Guided, Interactive Courses` or the `Video Courses`, depending on your learning style. Or you can just dive into the examples and play around!
